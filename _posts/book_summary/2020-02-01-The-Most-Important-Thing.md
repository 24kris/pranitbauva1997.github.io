# The Most Important Thing

By **Howard Marks**.



## Introduction

- Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, all at the same time. Omit any one and the result is likely to be less than satisfactory. That is why he has built this book around the idea of the most important things.
- No one arrives on the doorstep of an investment career with his or her philosophy fully formed. A philosophy has to be the sum of many ideas accumulated over a long period of time from a variety of sources. One cannot develop an effective philosophy without having been exposed to life's lessons.
- *"Experience is what you got when you didn't get what you wanted."* Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn't worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times.



## The Most Important Thing Is ... Second-Level Thinking

- A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to improve this easily attainable standard requires much application and more than a trace of wisdom.
- The definition of successful investing: **doing better than the market and other investors**. To accomplish that, you need either good luck or superior insight. It is very hard to teach insight.
- One's thinking has to be better than that of others -- both more powerful and at a higher level. Since other investors may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, one must find an edge others don't have. One must think of something they haven't thought of, see things others miss or bring insight others don't possess.
- Common things a second-level thinker takes into account:
  - What is the range of likely future outcomes?
  - Which outcome do I think will occur?
  - What's the probability I'm right?
  - What does the consensus think?
  - How does my expectation differ from the consensus?
  - How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?
  - Is the consensus psychology that's incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?
  - What will happen to the asset's price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I'm right?
- First level thinkers look for simple formulas and easy answers. Second level thinkers know that success in investing is the antithesis of simple.
- First level thinkers think the same way other first level thinkers do about the same things, and they generally reach the same conclusions. By definition, this can't be the route to superior results. All investors can't beat the market price, collectively, they are the market.
- The problem is that extraordinary performance comes only from correct nonconsensus forecasts, but nonconsensus forecasts are hard to make, hard to make correctly and hard to act on.
- Unconventionality shouldn't be a goal in itself, but rather a way of thinking. In order to distinguish yourself from others, it helps to have ideas that are different and to process those ideas differently.
