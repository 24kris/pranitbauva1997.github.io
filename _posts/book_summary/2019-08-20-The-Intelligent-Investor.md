# The Intelligent Investor

By **Benajmin Graham** updated with commentary by Jason Zweig

## 5. The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

### Investment Merits of Common Stocks

 - Common stocks were viewed as highly speculative and therefore unsafe;
   they had declined faily substantially from the high levels, but instead
   of attacting investors to them because of their reasonable prices, this
   fall had the opposite effect of undermining confidence in equities.
 - Big advance in stock price makes them appear safe and profitable
   investments at record high levels which might actually carry with them
   a considerable degree of risk.
 - Stocks offer a considerable degree of protection against the erosion
   of the investor's dollar caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered
   no protection at all.
 - Stocks also offer higher than average return to investors over the
   years. This was produced both by an average dividend income exceeding
   yield on good bonds by an underlying tendency for market value to
   increase over the years in consequence of the reinvestment of
   undistributed profits.
 - Thus, the defensive investor cannot afford to be without an appreciable
   proportion of common stocks in his portfolio, even if he must regard
   them as the lesser of the two evils -- the greater being the risks
   attached to an all-bond holding.

### Rules for the Common Stock Component

1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversification. This
   might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a maximum of about
   thirty.
2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively
   financed.
3. Each company shuold have a long record of continuous dividend payments.
4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for
   an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven
   years. Somewhere P/E of 20 or 25. This would ban the whole "growth
   stocks".

### Growth stocks and the Defensive Investor

 - The "growth stock" company is the one who's per-share earnings are
   growing at higher rates because they are expanding their business
   and are considered to do so in future too.
 - Such are attractive to buy and to own, provided the price paid is
   not excessive. Since they are sold at much higher multiples, a
   speculative element is attached to it which makes things tricky.
 - Growth stocks are more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some cases
   not only has the price fallen back but the earnings as well, thus
   causing a double discomfiture to those who owned them.
 - Considered super risky for defensive investors.
 - Wonders can be accomplished with the right individual selections, bought
   at the right levels, later sold after a huge rise and before the
   probable decline. But the average investor can no more expect to
   accomplish this than to find money growing on trees.

### Dollar-Cost Averaging

 - Invest the same dollar amount each month to buying one or more common
   stocks.
 - During rising-market experience, the results were certain to be highly
   satisfactory, especially since they prevented the practitioner from
   concentrating his buying at the wrong times.

### Investor's Personal Situation

 - Case **widow**: Widow left with $200k to support herself and her children.
   She needs conservatism in her investments. A division between
   government bonds and first-grade common stocks is a recommended. If
   she is an enterprising investor, she would have different objectives
   and methods. She should **never** take speculative chances in order to
   "make some extra income".
 - Case **doctor**: successful; mid-career with savings of $100k and yearly
   accretions of $10k. He has to ask himself whether he is willing to take
   a serious interest in the business of investment? If he lacks the
   impulse or the flair, he will do best to accept the easy role of the
   defensive investor. Portfolio divded between government bonds and
   first-grade common stocks. The average doctor may be more likely than
   the average widow to elect to become an enterprising investor, and he
   is perhaps more likely to succeed in the undertaking. But he can't give
   a lot of time to his investment education and to the administration of
   his funds.
 - Case **young man/student**: earning $200/week and saving $1,000/yr. The
   balance is so modest that it seems hardly worthwhile for him to undergo
   a tough education and temperamental discipline in order to qualify as
   an aggressive investor.
 - Finance has a hascination for many bright young people with limited
   means. They would like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the
   placement of their savings, even though investment income is much less
   important to them than their salaries. This attitude is great. A young
   capitalist should begin his financial education and experience as
   early as possible. If he is going to operate as an aggressive investor
   he is certain to make some mistakes and to take some losses. Youth can
   stand these disappointments and profit by them. We urge the beginner in
   security buying not to waste his efforts and his money in trying to
   beat the market. Let him study security values and initially test out
   his judgement on price versus value with the smallest possible sums.
   In such a scenario, the kind of securities to be purchased and the
   rate of return to be sought depend not on the investor's financial
   resources but on his financial equipment in terms of knowledge,
   experience and temperament.

### Note on the Concept of "Risk"

 - The concept that bonds are less risky than good preferred stocks and
   the latter less risky than good common stocks is inaccurate.
 - A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it default its interest or
   principal payments. If a preferred stock or a common stock bought
   with the expectation that a given rate of dividend will be continued,
   then a reduction of dividend means that it has proved unsafe.
 - The idea of risk is often applied to a possible decline in the price of
   a security and the holder is unlikely to be forced to sell at such
   times. This way of seeing risk doesn't feel useful.
 - The risk attached to an ordinary commercial business is measured by the
   chance of its losing money, not by what would happen if the owner is
   forced to sell.
 - If a group of well-selected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory
   overall return for a long stretch of time, then this group has proved
   to be "safe".
 - We prefer seeing risk as solely to a loss of value which either is
   realized through actual safe, or is caused by a significant deterioration
   in the company's position or the payment of an excessive price in
   relation to the intrinsic worth of the security.

### Note on the Category of "Large, Prominent, and Conservatively Financed Corporations"

 - For industrial companies, the common stock (at book value) represents
   at least half of the total capitalization.
 - "Large" and "prominent" means that the companies have a big size and
   a leading position in the industry.
 - There is no harm in having diversity of opinion and action when
   classifying companies on this criteria.

## 6. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach

 - The "aggressive" investor must divide his funds between high grade
   bonds and high grade common stocks bought at reasonable prices.
 - The selection of choice should only be restricted to individual's
   competence, equipment, interest and preferences.
 - Most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are of the
   negative sort like:
   - Avoid high grade preferred stocks
   - Avoid inferior types of bonds and preferred stocks unless it can be
     bought at a bargain of at least 30% under par for high coupon
     issues.
   - Avoid foreign-government bonds
   - Avoid new issues, convertible bonds, lucrative preferreds and
     common stocks with excellent earnings confined to the recent past.

### Second-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks

 - It doesn't make much sense to buy second-grade issues merely for the
   high return they offer.
 - Corporations with relatively poor credit standing find it difficult
   to sell "straight bonds" -- i.e., nonconvertible in public markets.
 - Almost all nonconvertible bonds of inferior rating represent older
   issues which are selling at a large discount. Thus they offer the
   possibility of a substantial gain in principal value if their credit
   rating improves or interest rates decrease.
 - The enterprising investor can probably get good grade bonds selling
   at a large discount wherein both income and chance of appreciation
   are possible.
 - It is unwise to buy a bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety
   merely because the yield is attractive.
 - During bad times, the securities which lack adequate safety prove
   highly susceptible to severe sinking spells and often interest or
   dividends get suspected and there is a price weakness.
 - An popular fallacy as a "business investment" involves purchasing
   a security showing a larger yield than is obtainable on a high-grade
   issue carrying a correspondingly greater risk.
 - Second-grade bonds and preferred stocks suffer severe sinking spells
   in bad markets.
 - The higher yields on second-grade will prove to have offset those
   principal losses that were irrecoverable.
 - If one buys second-grade issues at full prices, he will be worried
   and discommoded when their price declines precipitately. He also
   cannot buy enough issues to assure an "average" result, nor is he in
   position to set aside a portion of his larger income to offset or
   "amortize" those principal losses which prove to be permanent.

### Foreign Government Bonds

 - Usually a bad investment most visible during the two world wars
   and a world depression. Yet every few years market conditions are
   sufficiently favorable to permit the sale of some new foreign issues
   at price of about par.
 - This is because if trouble comes, the owner of foreign obligations
   has no legal or other means of enforcing his claim.
 - An investor would benefit both his country and himself if he declined
   such opportunities.

### New Issues Generally

 - Investors should be **weary** of new issues and should be thoroughly
   examined.
 - New issues have special salesmanship behind them which calls for a
   **special degree of sales resistance.** They are also sold under
   **"favourable market conditions"** which means they are favourable for
   the seller and less favourable for the buyer. New issues are sold
   with an underwriting discount which is much higher than brokerage
   fees.
 - The effect becomes more important as we move from highest-quality to
   second-grade senior issues.
 - Bull-market periods are usually characterized by the transformation
   of a large number of privately owned businesses into companies with
   quoted shares.

## 7. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

 - The enterprising investor should devote a fair amount of his
   attention and efforts twoard obtaining a better than run-of-the-mill
   investment result.

### Operations in Common Stocks

1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
2. Buying carefully chosen "growth stocks"
3. Buying bargain issues of various types
4. Buying into "special situations"

### General Market Policy -- Formula Timing

 - Timing the market has appeared both a simple and feasible idea upon
   inspecting the periodic fluctuations. The fluctuations that have
   taken place, while not inconsiderable in extent, would have required
   a special talent or "feel" for trading to take advantage of them.
   This is quite different from the intelligence in making sound
   investment decisions.

### Growth Stock Approach

 - A growth stock may be defined as one that has performed better than
   average over a period of years in the past and is expected to do so
   in the future.
 - Picking growth stocks is quite non-trivial.
 - Common stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell
   at correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his
   judgement of their prospects and still not fare particularly well,
   merely because he has paid in full (or perhaps overpaid) for the
   expected prosperity.
 - Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up forever; when a company has
   already registered a brilliant expansion, its very increase in size
   makes a repetition of its achievement more difficult. At some point
   the growth curve flattens out, and in many cases it turns downward.
 - The striking thing about growth stocks as a class is their tendency
   toward wide swings in the market price because **brilliant successes
   attacks a highly speculative element** into the shares of such
   companies.
 - The investment caliber of a company who's credit standing is of the
   best, and who pay the lowest interest rates on their borrowings may
   not change over a long span of years, but the risk characteristics
   of its stock will depend on what happens to it in the stock market.
   The more enthusiastic the public grows about it, and faster its
   advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the
   riskier a proposition it becomes.
 - The big fortunes from single-company investments are almost always
   realized by persons who have a close relationship with the particular
   company -- through employment, family connection, etc -- which
   justifies them in placing a large part of their resources in one
   medium and holding on to this commitment through all vicissitudes,
   despite numerous temptations to sell out at apparently high prices
   along the way. An investor without such close personal contact will
   constantly be faced with the question of whether too large a portion
   of his funds are in this one medium. Each decline will accentuate
   his problem; and internal and external pressures are likely to force
   him to take what seems to be a goodly profit, but one far less than
   the ultimate bonanza.

### Three Recommended Fields for "Enterprising Investment"

To obtain better than average investment results over a long pull requires
a policy of selection or operation possessing a twofold merit:

1. It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying soundness
2. It must be different from the policy followed by most investors or
   speculators.

The three investment approaches that meet these criteria are (each of these
differ widely from one another and each may require a different type of
knowledge and temperament by those who attempt it):

1. **The Relatively Unpopular Large Company**

 - The market overvalues stock which have been showing excellent growth
   or glamour for some reason and undervalues companies that are out of
   favour because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.
 - The enterprising investor should concentrate on the larger companies
   that are going through a period of unpopularity.
 - Small companies might also fit this criteria which can increase their
   earnings but they entail the risk of a definitive loss of profitability
   and also of protracted neglect by the market in spite of better
   earnings.
 - The larger companies also have the resources in capital and brain power
   carry them through adversity and back to a satisfactory earnings base.
   Also the market is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any
   improvement shown.
 - Companies that are inherently speculative because of widely varying
   earnings tend to sell both at a relatively high price and at a
   relatively low multiplier in their good years, and conversely at low
   prices and high multipliers in their bad years. In such cases, market
   has sufficient skepticism as to the continuation of the unusually high
   profits to value them conversatively, and conversely when earnings are
   low or nonexistent.

2. **Purchase of Bargain Issues**

 - Bargain issues are ones which appear to be worth considerably more
   than it is selling for.
 - The two tests for detecting bargain in common stocks:
   1. *Method of appraisal*: Estimate future earnings and then multiply
      these by a factor appropriate to the particular
      issue. If the resultant value is sufficiently above the market price
      and if the investor has confidence in the technique employed he can
      tag the stock as a bargain.
   2. *Value to a private owner*: This value is determined chiefly by
      expected future earnings in which case the result may be identical
      with the first. In such cases, pay more attention to the realizable
      value of the assets with particular emphasis on the net current
      assets or working capital.
 - The reasons for undervaluing companies by market:
   1. Currently disappointing results
   2. Protracted neglect or unpopularity
 - But neither of the above causes by itself alone can be relied on as
   a guide to successful common-stock investment.
 - Investors would need more than a mere falling off in both earnings
   and price to give him a sound basis for purchase.
 - The company could indicate about the reasonable stability of earnings
   over the past decade or more i.e. no year of earnings deficit -- plus
   sufficient size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in
   the future.
 - Ideal combination is a large and prominent company selling both well
   below its past average price and its past average price/earnings
   multiplier.
 - The type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a
   common stock that sells for less than company's net working capital
   alone, after deducting all prior obligations. Such opportunities cease
   to exist when market has considerably appreciated.
 - **Bargain Issue pattern in secondary companies**:
   - A company which isn't a leader in a fairly important industry.
   - Boom phase makes market think that middle-sized companies are strong
     enough to weather storms and that it had a better chance for really
     spectacular expansion but the depression years had a particularly
     devastating impact on the companies below the first rank either in
     size or in inherent stability.
   - The stock market's attitude toward secondary companies tends to be
     unrealistic and consequently to create a normal times innumerable
     instances of major undervaluation.

3. **Special Situations or "Workouts"**

 - Number of acquisitions of smaller firms by larger ones has increased
   because the larger firms thought they needed a diversification of
   products.
 - At times it is better to acquire an existing company in the market one
   wishes to enter rather than to start a new venture from scratch.
 - While acquiring, it is almost necessary to offer a price considerably
   above the current level so as to get approval from majority of
   shareholders.
 - Such situations often give arbitrage opportunities but one needs a sharp
   eye and shrewd mind to take the advantage of such opportunities.
 - The underlying factor for such situations is the tendency of the
   securities market to undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of
   complicated legal proceedings.
 - When the whole public follows some motto like: "*Never buy into a lawsuit*",
   there are plenty of bargain opportunities created since the prejudice
   against them holds their prices down to unduly low levels.
 - These situations require an unsual mentality and equipment and it's
   difficult to execute such strategies.

### Broader Implications of Our Rules for Investment

 - The aggressive investor must have a considerable knowledge of security
   values -- enough, in fact, to warrant viewing his security operations
   as equivalent to a business enterprise. There is no room in this
   philosophy as a middle ground between passive and aggressive status.
 - **If you try to place yourself in an intermediate category, it's a
   compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than
   achievement.**
 - An investor cannot soundly become "half a business-man", expecting
   thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business profits on your
   funds.
 - If one cannot dedicate time, determination or mental equipment to embark
   upon investing as a quasi-business, they should be satisfied with the
   excellent return now obtainable from a defensive portfolio and should
   resist the recurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating
   into other paths.
 - The enterprising investor may properly embark upon any security
   operation for which his training and judgement are adequate and which
   appears sufficiently promising when measured by established business
   standards.
 - Defensive investor should focus on the underlying safety, simplicity
   of choice, and promise of satisfactory results, in terms of psychology
   as well as arithmetic.
 - Investor may expect satisfactory results, on the average, from secondary
   common stocks only if he buys them for less than their value to a
   private owner on a bargain basis.
 - Anyone who can **control** a secondary company, or who is part of a
   cohesive group with such control, is fully justified in buying the
   shares on the same basis as if he were investing in a "close corporation"
   or other private business. The distinction between the position, and
   consequent investment policy, of insiders and of outsiders become more
   important as the enterprise itself becomes less important.
 - In a primary company a single detached share is ordinarily worth as much
   as a share in a controlling block.
 - In a secondary company, the average market value of a detached share is
   substantially less than its worth to a controlling owner.
 - Because of this fact, the matter of shareholder-management relations
   and of those between inside and outside shareholders tends to be much
   more important and controversial in the case of a secondary than in that
   of a primary.
 - Many common stocks belong to the boundary area of primary and secondary
   companies and thus exhibit an intermediate price behavior. It wouldn't
   be illogical for an investor to buy such an issue at a small discount
   from its indicated or appraisal value.
 - **Investor's choice as between the defensive or the aggressive status is
   of major consequence to him, and he should not allow himself to be
   confused or compromised in this basic decision.**

## 8. The Investor and Market Fluctuations

 - The investor should know about the possibilities of market fluctuations
   and should be prepared for them financially and psychologically.
 - He would want to benefit from changes in market levels by making
   purchases at advantageous prices. While this is inevitable and
   legitimate, it involves the **very real danger of leading him to
   speculative attitudes and activities.**
 - If you want to speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you
   will probably lose money in the end and thus limit the amount at risk
   and to separate it completely from your investment program.

### Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions

 - An investor can profit from the wide fluctuations in market prices
   by the **way of timing** and **the way of pricing**.
 - If an investor places more emphasis on timing in the sense of
   forecasting, he will end up as a speculator and with a speculator's
   financial results.
 - The investor shouldn't take the predictions and stock market
   forecasting seriously.
 - While some people can make money by being good forecasters, it's
   absurd to think that the general public can.
 - Timing is of great psychological importance to the speculator
   because he wants to make his profit in a hurry. The idea of waiting
   a year before his stock moves up is repugnant to him.
 - But a waiting period is of no consequence to the investor because
   there is no advantage in sitting on cash to receive some trustworthy
   signal that the time has come to buy. He enjoys an advantage only
   if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently lower
   price to offset his loss of dividend income.
 - The formulas for buying and selling stocks have worked well over a
   period is because they have been plausibly adapted to the statistical
   record of the past. But as their acceptance increases, their
   reliability tends to diminish. This happens because with the passage
   of time, market adapts to new conditions wherein the old formula
   no longer fits and in stock-markets, the popularity of a trading
   theory has itself an influence on the market's behaviour which
   detracts in the long run from its profit making possiblities.

### Buy Low and Sell High Approach

 - A classic definition of a shrewd investor: *One who buys in bear
   market when everyone else was selling, and sells out in a bull market
   when everyone else was buying.*
 - Characteristics of a bull market:
   1. A historically high price level
   2. High P/E ratio
   3. Low dividend yields as against bond yields
   4. Speculation on margin (loan)
   5. Many offerings of new common-stock issues of poor quality
 - The longer the bull market lasts, the more people think that bear
   markets are impossible.
 - It is recommended to make provisions in changing the proportion of
   common stocks to bonds in the portfolio according to the level of
   stock prices appearing less or more attractive by value standard.

### Formula Plans

 - A strategy like selling some common stocks when the market advances
   substantially does sound logical but often markets continue to
   become more over-valued and thus such strategies don't earn a better
   return than dollar cost averaging.
 - Any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be easily
   described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too simple
   and too easy to last

### Market Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio

 - A serious investor won't believe that the day-to-day or even month-
   to-month fluctuations would make him richer or poorer.
 - **A substantial rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for
   satisfaction and a cause for prudent concern, but it may also bring
   a strong temptation toward imprudent action.**
 - It is because of human nature to follow crowds rather than by
   calculation of financial gain or loss, that it is recommended to
   have some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of
   bonds to stocks in the investor's portfolio. The chief advantage of
   this is that such a formula will give the investor something to do
   which would be an outlet for his otherwise too-pent-up energies. If
   he is the right kind of investor he will take added satisfaction from
   the thought that his operations are exactly opposite from those of
   the crowd.

### Business Valuation versus Stock-Market Valuations

 - The holder of marketable shares has many advantages as compared to
   a private-business owner.
 - He is a silent partner and his results are entirely dependent on the
   profits of the enterprise or on a change in the underlying value of
   its assets.
 - He can also sell the stock in a matter of minutes when the market
   is open which is often far removed from the balance-sheet value
 - The better a company's record and prospects, the less relationship
   the price of its shares will have to their book value. But the greater
   the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of
   determining its intrinsic value i.e. the more this "value" will
   depend on the changing moods and measurements of the stock market.
   The more successful the company, the greater fluctuations in the
   price of its shares.** The better the quality of a common stock, the
   *more speculative* it is likely to be.** Such losses do not indicate
   any doubt about the long-term growth of the company but they reflect
   a lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock market
   itself had placed on these excellent prospects.
 - **A stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be
   bought at close to its asset value. The investor should demand, in
   addition, a satisfactory ratio of earnings to price, a sufficiently
   strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will
   at least be maintained over the years.** Once the investor is willing
   to forgo brilliant prospects i.e. better than average expected
   growth, he will have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of
   issues meeting this criteria.
 - An investor who has picked stocks at their book value can take a
   much more independent and detached view of the stock market
   fluctuations than those who have paid high multipliers of both
   earnings and tangible assets as long as the earning power of his
   holdings remains satisfactory.
 - Most businesses change in character and quality over the years more
   often for the worse. One must give his companies' performance a
   hard look from time to time.
 - **The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and
   at all other times he is free to disregard the current price
   quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the
   extent that it suits his book, and no more. Thus the investor who
   permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified
   market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic
   advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if
   his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be
   spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons' mistakes of
   judgement.**
 - It is self-deception to tell yourself that you have suffered no
   shrinkage in value merely because your securities have no quoted
   market at all.
 - With listed common stocks, the investor has the benefit of the stock
   market's daily and changing appraisal of his holdings, for whatever
   that appraisal may be worth, and second, that the investor is able
   to increase or decrease his investment at the market's daily figure
   **if he chooses**. Thus the existence of a quoted market gives the
   investor certain options that he does not have if his security is
   unquoted. But it does not impose the current quotation on an investor
   who prefers to take his idea of value from some other source.
 - The shrewd investor would be happy to sell out to Mr. Market when
   he quotes a ridiculously high price, and equally happy to buy from
   him when his price is low. But the rest of the time, he is wise
   enough to take that time to form his own ideas of the value of his
   holdings based on full reports from the company about its operations
   and financial position.

### Summary

 - The speculator's primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting
   from market fluctuations. The investor's primary interest lies in
   acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.
 - An investor shouldn't regularly hold off buying until low market
   levels appear, because this may involve a long wait, very likely
   the loss of income and the possible missing of investment opportunities.
   It is better to buy stock whenever you have the money to put into
   stocks except when the general market level is much higher than can
   be justified.
 - The work of many intelligent minds constantly engaged in the field of
   sector rotation tends to be self-neutralizing and self-defeating
   over the years.
 - The investor must see his management team successful by comparing
   it to the long-range trend of the average to test the effectiveness
   of a company's management and the soundness of its attitude towards
   the owner of the business.
 - Price fluctuations of convertible bonds and preferred stocks are the
   resultant of these factors:
   1. Variations in the price of the related common stock
   2. Variations in the credit standing of the company
   3. Variations in general interest rates
 - Investing isn't about beating other at their game. It's about
   controlling yourself at your own game.
