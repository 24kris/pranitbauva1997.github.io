## 4. The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

### Investment Merits of Common Stocks

 - Common stocks were viewed as highly speculative and therefore unsafe;
   they had declined faily substantially from the high levels, but instead
   of attacting investors to them because of their reasonable prices, this
   fall had the opposite effect of undermining confidence in equities.
 - Big advance in stock price makes them appear safe and profitable
   investments at record high levels which might actually carry with them
   a considerable degree of risk.
 - Stocks offer a considerable degree of protection against the erosion
   of the investor's dollar caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered
   no protection at all.
 - Stocks also offer higher than average return to investors over the
   years. This was produced both by an average dividend income exceeding
   yield on good bonds by an underlying tendency for market value to
   increase over the years in consequence of the reinvestment of
   undistributed profits.
 - Thus, the defensive investor cannot afford to be without an appreciable
   proportion of common stocks in his portfolio, even if he must regard
   them as the lesser of the two evils -- the greater being the risks
   attached to an all-bond holding.

### Rules for the Common Stock Component

1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversification. This
   might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a maximum of about
   thirty.
2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively
   financed.
3. Each company shuold have a long record of continuous dividend payments.
4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for
   an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven
   years. Somewhere P/E of 20 or 25. This would ban the whole "growth
   stocks".

### Growth stocks and the Defensive Investor

 - The "growth stock" company is the one who's per-share earnings are
   growing at higher rates because they are expanding their business
   and are considered to do so in future too.
 - Such are attractive to buy and to own, provided the price paid is
   not excessive. Since they are sold at much higher multiples, a
   speculative element is attached to it which makes things tricky.
 - Growth stocks are more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some cases
   not only has the price fallen back but the earnings as well, thus
   causing a double discomfiture to those who owned them.
 - Considered super risky for defensive investors.
 - Wonders can be accomplished with the right individual selections, bought
   at the right levels, later sold after a huge rise and before the
   probable decline. But the average investor can no more expect to
   accomplish this than to find money growing on trees.

### Dollar-Cost Averaging

 - Invest the same dollar amount each month to buying one or more common
   stocks.
 - During rising-market experience, the results were certain to be highly
   satisfactory, especially since they prevented the practitioner from
   concentrating his buying at the wrong times.

### Investor's Personal Situation

 - Case **widow**: Widow left with $200k to support herself and her children.
   She needs conservatism in her investments. A division between
   government bonds and first-grade common stocks is a recommended. If
   she is an enterprising investor, she would have different objectives
   and methods. She should **never** take speculative chances in order to
   "make some extra income".
 - Case **doctor**: successful; mid-career with savings of $100k and yearly
   accretions of $10k. He has to ask himself whether he is willing to take
   a serious interest in the business of investment? If he lacks the
   impulse or the flair, he will do best to accept the easy role of the
   defensive investor. Portfolio divded between government bonds and
   first-grade common stocks. The average doctor may be more likely than
   the average widow to elect to become an enterprising investor, and he
   is perhaps more likely to succeed in the undertaking. But he can't give
   a lot of time to his investment education and to the administration of
   his funds.
 - Case **young man/student**: earning $200/week and saving $1,000/yr. The
   balance is so modest that it seems hardly worthwhile for him to undergo
   a tough education and temperamental discipline in order to qualify as
   an aggressive investor.
 - Finance has a hascination for many bright young people with limited
   means. They would like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the
   placement of their savings, even though investment income is much less
   important to them than their salaries. This attitude is great. A young
   capitalist should begin his financial education and experience as
   early as possible. If he is going to operate as an aggressive investor
   he is certain to make some mistakes and to take some losses. Youth can
   stand these disappointments and profit by them. We urge the beginner in
   security buying not to waste his efforts and his money in trying to
   beat the market. Let him study security values and initially test out
   his judgement on price versus value with the smallest possible sums.
   In such a scenario, the kind of securities to be purchased and the
   rate of return to be sought depend not on the investor's financial
   resources but on his financial equipment in terms of knowledge,
   experience and temperament.

### Note on the Concept of "Risk"

 - The concept that bonds are less risky than good preferred stocks and
   the latter less risky than good common stocks is inaccurate.
 - A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it default its interest or
   principal payments. If a preferred stock or a common stock bought
   with the expectation that a given rate of dividend will be continued,
   then a reduction of dividend means that it has proved unsafe.
 - The idea of risk is often applied to a possible decline in the price of
   a security and the holder is unlikely to be forced to sell at such
   times. This way of seeing risk doesn't feel useful.
 - The risk attached to an ordinary commercial business is measured by the
   chance of its losing money, not by what would happen if the owner is
   forced to sell.
 - If a group of well-selected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory
   overall return for a long stretch of time, then this group has proved
   to be "safe".
 - We prefer seeing risk as solely to a loss of value which either is
   realized through actual safe, or is caused by a significant deterioration
   in the company's position or the payment of an excessive price in
   relation to the intrinsic worth of the security.

### Note on the Category of "Large, Prominent, and Conservatively Financed Corporations"

 - For industrial companies, the common stock (at book value) represents
   at least half of the total capitalization.
 - "Large" and "prominent" means that the companies have a big size and
   a leading position in the industry.
 - There is no harm in having diversity of opinion and action when
   classifying companies on this criteria.
