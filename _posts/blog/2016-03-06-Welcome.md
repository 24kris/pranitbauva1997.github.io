I guess this is the final time I am changing the theme of my website. I
hope to stick to this theme and now further start developing on the
website.

Some tasks that needs to be done ASAP:

 - Write the `About` page.
 - Write about all the projects I have done in the `Projects` page.
 - Write about my talks by creating a new `Talks` navigation bar.
 - Write about my workshops as blog posts.
