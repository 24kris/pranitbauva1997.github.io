# The Most Important Thing

By **Howard Marks**.



## Introduction

- Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, all at the same time. Omit any one and the result is likely to be less than satisfactory. That is why he has built this book around the idea of the most important things.
- No one arrives on the doorstep of an investment career with his or her philosophy fully formed. A philosophy has to be the sum of many ideas accumulated over a long period of time from a variety of sources. One cannot develop an effective philosophy without having been exposed to life's lessons.
- *"Experience is what you got when you didn't get what you wanted."* Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn't worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times.



## Second-Level Thinking

- A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to improve this easily attainable standard requires much application and more than a trace of wisdom.
- The definition of successful investing: **doing better than the market and other investors**. To accomplish that, you need either good luck or superior insight. It is very hard to teach insight.
- One's thinking has to be better than that of others -- both more powerful and at a higher level. Since other investors may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, one must find an edge others don't have. One must think of something they haven't thought of, see things others miss or bring insight others don't possess.
- Common things a second-level thinker takes into account:
  - What is the range of likely future outcomes?
  - Which outcome do I think will occur?
  - What's the probability I'm right?
  - What does the consensus think?
  - How does my expectation differ from the consensus?
  - How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?
  - Is the consensus psychology that's incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?
  - What will happen to the asset's price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I'm right?
- First level thinkers look for simple formulas and easy answers. Second level thinkers know that success in investing is the antithesis of simple.
- First level thinkers think the same way other first level thinkers do about the same things, and they generally reach the same conclusions. By definition, this can't be the route to superior results. All investors can't beat the market price, collectively, they are the market.
- The problem is that extraordinary performance comes only from correct nonconsensus forecasts, but nonconsensus forecasts are hard to make, hard to make correctly and hard to act on.
- Unconventionality shouldn't be a goal in itself, but rather a way of thinking. In order to distinguish yourself from others, it helps to have ideas that are different and to process those ideas differently.



## Understanding Market Efficiency (and it's Limitations)

- The efficient market hypothesis states that
  - There are many participants in the markets, and they share roughly equal access to all relevant information. They are intelligent, objective, highly motivated and hardworking. Their analytical models are widely known and employed.
  - Because of the collective efforts of these participants information is reflected fully and immediately in the market price of each asset. And because market participants will move instantly to buy any asset that's too cheap or sell one that's too dear, assets are priced fairly in the absolute and relative to each other.
  - Thus, market prices represent accurate estimates of assets' intrinsic value, and no participant can consistently identify and profit from instances when they are wrong.
  - Assets therefore sell at prices from which they can be expected to deliver risk-adjusted returns that are "fair" relative to other assets. Riskier assets must offer higher returns in order to attract buyers. The market will set prices so that appears to be the case, but it won't provide a "free lunch". That is, there will be no incremental return that is not related to (and compensatory for) incremental risk.
- If prices in efficient markets already reflect the consensus, then sharing the consensus view will make you likely to earn just an average return. To beat the market you must hold an idiosyncratic, or nonconsensus view.
- According to investment theory, people are risk-averse by nature, meaning that in general they'd rather bear less risk than more. For them to make riskier investments, they have to be induced through the promise of higher returns. Thus, markets will adjust the prices of investments so that, based on the known facts and common perceptions the riskier ones will appear to promise higher returns.
- Once in a while we experience periods when everything goes well and riskier investments deliver the higher returns they seem to promise. Those halcyon periods lull people into believing that to get higher returns, all they have to do is make riskier investments. But they ignore something that is easily forgotten in good times: this can't be true, because if riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn't be riskier.
- Every once in a while, then, people learn an essential lesson. They realize that nothing -- and certainly not the indiscriminate acceptance of risk -- carries the promise of a free lunch, and they're reminded of the limitations of investment theory.
- Common properties of efficient asset classes:
  - the asset class is widely known and has a broad following;
  - the class is socially acceptable, not controversial or taboo;
  - the merits of the class are clear and comprehensible, at least on the surface;
  - information about the class and its components is distributed widely and evenly.
- With millions of people doing similar analysis on the basis of similar information, how often will stocks become mis-priced, and how often will stocks become mis-priced, and how regularly can any one person detect those mis-pricing?
- Second-level thinkers know that, to achieve superior results, they have to have an edge in either information or analysis, or both. They are on the alert for instances of mis perception.
- But it's impossible to argue that market prices are always right. In fact, if you look at the four assumptions just listed, one stands out as particularly tenuous: objectivity. Human beings are driven by greed, fear, envy and other emotions that render objectivity impossible and open the door for significant mistakes.
- A market characterized by mistakes and mis pricing can be beaten by people with rare insight. Thus, the existence of inefficiencies gives rise to the possibility of out performance and is a necessary condition for it. It does not, however, guarantee it.
- Common characteristics of inefficient market:
  - Market prices are often wrong. Because access to information and the analysis thereof are highly imperfect, market prices are often far above or far below intrinsic value.
  - The risk-adjusted returns on one asset class can be far out of line with those of other asset classes. Because assets are often values at other than fair prices, an asset class can deliver a risk-adjusted return that is significantly too high or a too low relative to other asset classes.
  - Some investors can consistently outperform others. Because of existence of:
    - significant mis-valuations
    - differences among participants in terms of skill, insight and information access, it is possible for mis valuation to be identified and profited from with regularity.
- Inefficient markets do not necessarily give their participants generous returns. Rather, it's my view that they provide the raw material -- mis pricing -- that can be allow some people to win and others to lose on the basis of differential skill. If prices can be very wrong, that means it's possible to find bargains or overpay. For every person who gets a good buy in an inefficient market, someone else sells too cheap. One of the great sayings about poker is that "in every game there's a fish. If you've played for an hour and haven't figured out who the fish is, then it's you."
- Efficiency is not so universal that we should give up on superior performance. At the same time, efficiency is what lawyers call a "rebuttable presumption" -- something that should be presumed to be true until someone proves otherwise.
- Ways to think about efficiencies:
  - Why should a bargain exist despite the presence of thousands of investors who stand ready and willing to bid up the price of anything that's too cheap?
  - If the return appears so generous in proportion to the risk, might you be overlooking some hidden risk?
  - Why would the seller of the asset be willing to part with it at a price from which it will give you an excessive return?
  - Do you really know more about the asset than the seller does?
  - If it's such a great proposition, why hasn't someone else snapped it up?
- It pays off better to work in relatively inefficient markets where hard work and skill would pay off best.





## Value

- Value investors aim to come up with a security's current intrinsic value and buy when the price is lower, and growth investors try to find securities whose value will increase rapidly in the future.
- To value investors, an asset isn't an ephemeral concept you invest in because you think it's attractive (or think others will find it attractive). It's a tangible object that should have an intrinsic value capable of being ascertained, and if it can be bought below its intrinsic value, you might consider doing so. Thus, intelligent investing has to be built on estimates of intrinsic value. Those estimates must be derived rigorously, based on all of the available information.
- The quest in value investing is for cheapness. Value investors typically look at financial metrics such as earnings, cash flow, dividends, hard assets and enterprise value and emphasize buying cheap on these bases. The primary goal of value investors, then, is to quantify the company's current value and buy its securities when they can do so cheaply.
- Growth investing lies somewhere between the dull plodding of value investing and the adrenaline charge of momentum investing. Its goal is to identify companies with bright futures. That means by definition that there's less emphasis on the company's current attributes and more on its potential.
- The difference between two principal schools of investing can be boiled down to:
  - Value investors buy stocks (even those whose intrinsic value may show little growth in the future) out of conviction that the current value is high relative to the current price.
  - Growth investors buy stocks (even those whose current value is low relative to their current price) because they believe the value will grow fast enough in the future to produce substantial appreciation.
- Compared to value investing, growth investing centers around trying for big winners. If big winners weren't in the offing, why put up with the uncertainty entailed in guess at the future? There's no question about it: it's harder to see the future than the present. Thus, the batting average for growth investors should be lower, but the payoff for doing it well might be higher. The return for correctly predicting which companies will come up with the best new drug, most powerful computer or best-selling movies should be substantial.
- Value investing can't consistently produce good returns without an accurate estimate of value. Without that, any hope for consistent success as an investor is just that: hope. Without accurate estimates, you'll be as likely to overpay as to underpay. And if you overpay, it takes a surprising improvement in value, a strong market or an even less discriminating buyer (what we used to call a "greater fool") to bail you out.
- Also, if one has settled on the value approach to investing and come up with an intrinsic value for a security or asset, the next important thing is to hold it firmly. That's because in the world of investing, being correct about something isn't at all synonymous with being proved correct right away.
- The most value investors can hope for is to be right about an asset's value and buy when it's available for less. But doing so today certainly doesn't mean you're going to start making money tomorrow. A firmly held view on value can help you cope with this disconnect.
- Chances to buy well below actual value don't come along every day, and you should welcome them. Warren Buffett describes them as "buying dollars for fifty cents".
- In investing many people tend to fall further in love with the thing they've bought as its price rises, since they feel validated, and they like it less as the price falls, when they begin to doubt their decision to buy.
- Investors with no knowledge of (or concern for) profits, dividends, valuation or conduct of business simply cannot possess the resolve needed to do the right thing at the right time. With everyone around them buying and making money, they can't know when a stock is too high and therefore resist joining in. And with a market free fall, they can't possibly have the confidence needed to hold or buy at severely reduced prices.
