I'm a student at [**IIT Kharagpur**](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), pursing a
dual degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) in Engineering. I am a robotics and open
source enthusiast. I am also a contributor to git. If you have messed
up your git repository or need source control advice, I am your guy!

I play volleyball, throwball, handball, football, athletics, ruby and
many more. I like to exercise to keep myself fit. I was the **Sports
Captain** of my school [Vissanji Academy](http://vissanjiacademy.com/)
where I learned all of the sports I mentioned above and
also the captain of the volleyball and throwball team at
[Mithibai College](http://mithibai.ac.in/).

Also, I like tasting different types of alcohol. I have attended wine
tasting in [Sula Vineyards](http://www.sulawines.com/) and also beer
tasting in [Brussels Event Brewery](https://www.eventbrewery.eu/) as
an after-party of [Git Merge](http://git-merge.com/).
