I'm a student at [**IIT Kharagpur**](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), pursing a
dual degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) in Engineering. I am a robotics and open
source enthusiast. I am also a contributor to
[git](https://github.com/git/git). If you have messed
up your git repository or need source control advice, I am your guy! I
got selected in the **Google Summer of Code** program in my first year wherein
I worked on porting the `git-bisect` shell script to C code so as to do
my bit in making life of windows developers easier and less frustrating.

As you might have guess, I code a **LOT**. You can follow me on
[**Github**](https://github.com/pranitbauva1997). I upload most of the code
that I have written on the
[github repo](https://github.com/pranitbauva1997?tab=repositories)
though some are in private
repositories. I have done many projects which you can check out in my
[github profile](https://github.com).

I am currently an _**Executive Head**_ at
[Kharagpur Open Source Society](http://kossiitkgp.in/) where we try
to promote open source culture in our campus. We organize workshops
for Git, Dual Booting fest, GSoC seminar and various other stuffs. Our
flagship event is Kharagpur Winter of Code wherein we help students by
assigning them mentors to guide them when they get started with contributing
to open source software.

I am also the _**Software Team Head**_ at
[Swarm Robotics IIT KGP](http://swarm-iitkgp.github.io/)
where I lead the communications team which is
working on decentralized communication for mobile robots. I also lead the
Computer Vision team which works on 3D reconstruction and distributed vision.

I play volleyball, throwball, handball, football, athletics, ruby and
many more. I like to exercise to keep myself fit. I was the **Sports
Captain** of my school [Vissanji Academy](http://vissanjiacademy.com/)
where I learned all of the sports I mentioned above and
also the captain of the volleyball and throwball team at
[Mithibai College](http://mithibai.ac.in/).

The external repositories/organisations I contribute to in my free time are:

 - [kossiitkgp: Maintainer](https://github.com/kossiitkgp)

Also, I like tasting different types of alcohol. I have attended wine
tasting in [Sula Vineyards](http://www.sulawines.com/) and also beer
tasting in [Brussels Event Brewery](https://www.eventbrewery.eu/) as
an after-party of [Git Merge](http://git-merge.com/).
