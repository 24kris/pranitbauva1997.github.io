I'm a student at [**IIT Kharagpur**](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), pursing a
dual degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) in Engineering. I am a robotics and open
source enthusiast. I am also a contributor to
[git](https://github.com/git/git). If you have messed
up your git repository or need source control advice, I am your guy!

As you might have guess, I code a **LOT**. You can follow me on
[**Github**](https://github.com/pranitbauva1997). I upload most of the code
that I have written on the
[github repo](https://github.com/pranitbauva1997?tab=repositories)
though some are in private
repositories. I have done many projects which you can check out in my
github profile.

I am currently an _**Executive Head**_ at
[Kharagpur Open Source Society](http://kossiitkgp.in/) where we try
to promote open source culture in our campus. We organize workshops
for Git, Dual Booting fest, GSoC seminar and various other stuffs.

I am also the _**Software Team Head**_ at
[Swarm Robotics IIT KGP](http://swarm-iitkgp.github.io/)
where I lead the communications team which is
working on decentralized communication for robots.

I am also a _**Computer Vision Head**_ at
[Technology Robotix Society](https://www.robotix.in/) wherein we try to
promote robotics culture in our university by organising
[KRAIG classes](https://www.robotix.in/kraig/),
[Winter Workshop](https://www.robotix.in/kraig/) and we organize an
annual technical fest.

I play volleyball, throwball, handball, football, athletics, ruby and
many more. I like to exercise to keep myself fit. I was the **Sports
Captain** of my school [Vissanji Academy](http://vissanjiacademy.com/)
where I learned all of the sports I mentioned above and
also the captain of the volleyball and throwball team at
[Mithibai College](http://mithibai.ac.in/).

Also, I like tasting different types of alcohol. I have attended wine
tasting in [Sula Vineyards](http://www.sulawines.com/) and also beer
tasting in [Brussels Event Brewery](https://www.eventbrewery.eu/) as
an after-party of [Git Merge](http://git-merge.com/).
